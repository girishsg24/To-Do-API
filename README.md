# WEB-SERVER-and-a-To-Do-API
1. I developed a restful back end server to handle crud requests for day to day tasks.
2. The server would handle http methods like get, post, put & delete to interact with sqlite database to provide a response.
3. I used node js & express js framework to implement the server. Since this was a backend project I tested the method using postman software & deployed the server on Heroku. 
4. Made use of RESTful architecture to build a client-server model & a To-do API connected to SQLite database. 
Technologies: Node.js, Express.js, SQLite, Sequelize, Postman
