				<h3></h3>
				<h2>To Create a task</h2>
				<p>Use postman  and send a post request to the url https://sjsu-team5-todo-api.herokuapp.com/todos/ with a JSON object.</p>
				<p>JSON object format Eg:</p>
				<p>{</p>
				<p> "description" : "Be Batman and save the city!",</p>
				<p> "completed" : false</p>
				<p>}</p>
				<h2>To Update a task</h2>
				<p>Use postman  and send a put request to the url https://sjsu-team5-todo-api.herokuapp.com/todos/'id' with a JSON object.</p>
				<p>'id' being equal to the id of the task that you would like to update.</p>
				<p>JSON object is again in the same format as above but you can decide to skip the attribute that you do not intend to change.</p>
				<p></p>
				<h2>To Delete a task</h2>
				<p>Use Postman and send a delete request to the url https://sjsu-team5-todo-api.herokuapp.com/todos/'id'</p>
				<p>'id' being equal to the id of the task that you would like to delete.</p>
				<p></p>
				<h2>To retrieve all the tasks</h2>
				<p>Use Postman and send a get request to the url https://sjsu-team5-todo-api.herokuapp.com/todos</p>
				<p></p>
				<h2>To retrieve a selected task.</h2>
				<p>Use Postman and send a get request to the url https://sjsu-team5-todo-api.herokuapp.com/todos/'id'</p>
				<p>'id' being equal to the id of the task that you would like to fetch.</p>
				<p></p>
				<h2>To retrieve task based on filters.</h2>
				<p><p>Use Postman and send a get request to the url https://sjsu-team5-todo-api.herokuapp.com/todos followed by ? and the query.</p>
				<p>For Eg: To fetch all the tasks with completed status set to false</p>
				<p>https://sjsu-team5-todo-api.herokuapp.com/todos/?completed=false</p>
				<p>Similarly to fetch all the taks whose description contains a certain word.</p>
				<p>https://sjsu-team5-todo-api.herokuapp.com/todos/?q=batman</p>
				<p>You could decide to chain to have both the filters.</p>
				<p>https://sjsu-team5-todo-api.herokuapp.com/todos/?q=batman&completed=false</p>
